## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="star/readme/images/malefi6m.jpg"> This mod adds an elven neutral evil assassin who can first join the party in Irenicus' lovely underground hole. Silver Star is partially insane (*we don't want to say mad*), and has some childhood complex: for example, she has a true obsession for sweet little lambs... She is chronically poisoned, which explains her high tolerance to poison and her low constitution. She is a remorseless killer, when in a normal mood, and does some evil things, like gambling, blackmailing, killing, stealing and so on... She has crude and cruel dialogues, and banters with NPCs in SoA, but not in ToB.

:warning: &#9755; Note that even if we had tried to avoid any mild language this mod contains violent or cruel dialogues. Silver Star is an assassin and she acts of like mind doing things like murdering, stealing kidnapping and so on... If you don't like this kind of behaviour simply say to Silver to cease this things and she will stop after some time. If you continue to let her be indulge in her psychotic indulgences then she will probably get worse...
 :wink:

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

&#9755; This version contains content for Shadows of Amn only, so while Silver Star will be functional in a Throne of Bhaal game, she will not speak to you.

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

The Silver Star NPC mod is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you do encounter an error, please let us know by <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/61082-silver-star-npc-updated-to-v200-ee-compatible/">reporting it on the forum</a>.<br>

## 

#### Installation Order

>Although it is not required for Silver Star to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Silver Star after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install Silver Star before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-star.exe`__, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: star folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Silver Star NPC for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: star folder and a setup-star.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-star.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-star.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### macOS

Silver Star NPC for macOS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: star folder, setup-star and setup-star.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-star.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-star.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Silver Star NPC for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-star`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-star --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

#### Special Acknowledgements to:

- <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/">Spellhold Studios</a> team for hosting the mod (<a href="http://www.shsforums.net">Forums</a>).
- Davide Carta for starting the concept and allowing it to be developed without his future guidance. We've done what we can with the mod and hope it honours both what he had in mind and what people may have been expecting of the original.
- Diana: When my own personal life "hit the fan", Diana continued the development and the coding of the mod as my attentions and efforts were elsewhere. She took it upon her herself to fix bugs that I'd missed as well as adding additional material. She also saw fit to beta test on her own before sending the material onto the gang. The mod owes her much.
- Dancer Fitz: One of the mainstays of the team in that she has submitted and written vast amounts of banter, dialogue, ideas and so on for this mod. We also owe her a lot for improving the standard of English vastly from Davide's original version (he was an Italian native). Her own impact cannot be fairly assessed but its all appreciated.
- TGM for his balancing perspectives and occasional plot suggestions. The number of disagreements and heated exchanges we had in the private forum vary but his help and insight have always been appreciated.
- St. Jo for adding her strong, beautiful voice to Silver Star. This was never an easy one to act out but she did it superbly.
- Neil Sharp for hosting this project and supplying it with both a public and a private forum.
- Ryan (aka, Wizard of Thay) for his help in the correction of English and for the long comments to each dialogue and the suggestions for expand this work.
- Erik Manning (Icelus) for discovering how to add the infamous HTML readme file!
- Shar for commentary, idea submission and bouncing ideas off.
- Efreeti for also submitting dialogues, comments and ideas, for joining the team at such a late stage.
- Prowler for the Russian translation and Austin for proofreading it.
- AL|EN: Wrote process which automatically provides Windows, Linux and Mac versions in the same archive file.
- On the technical angle, we'd like to thank Westley Weimer (creation of WeiDU), the bigg (maintaining and adding to WeiDU), igi (maintaining IESDP), Jason Compton & Jesse Myers (player-initiated dialogue technology), Avenger (DLTCEP), Simding0, Ghreyfain, Blue, Rastor and CamDawg (tutorials), and everyone at the Q&amp;A forums who helped out when we were having difficulties.
